/**
  Exercise #2:
  
  Edit the Circle class to have a static variable named "numCircles". This variable should keep track of how many instances of Circle have been created.

  Add a static getter method called getNumCircles that returns this variale.

  Edit Main.java in repl.it to create a few circles and print out the value of Circle.numCircles after each insatnce is created to see that it is getting updated properly.

  Hint:
