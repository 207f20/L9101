// EXERCISE 4: Copy/paste your code for GUIApp1 here but replace TextView with two GUIView instances. The GUIView
//				instances are UI labels, so after doing this you need to make sure you add the two GUIView
//				instances onto the gridpane: e.g. grid.add(guiView1, 1, 0); grid.add(guiView2, 1, 1);
//			   Try running the code and playing around with the new view.
//			   Next, try replacing the GUIView instances with GUIView2. Again try running the code and playing around with it.
//
//		Note - do NOT modify the GUIView files or the Balloon file at all

// Briefly explain the difference between the two views as a comment below:
//
//
//
//

public class GUIApp2 {

}
