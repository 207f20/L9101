EXERCISE 2

(WARNING: This exercise may make you crave pizza)

2.1 Create a new DeluxePizzaBuilder class which creates a pizza that has extra cheese, extra sauce, pepperoni, pinapple and tomato.
(use HawaiianPizzaBuilder for reference)

2.2 Finish all the TODOs in ClientMain and run the code to try out your pizza building app


2.3
(for practice and understanding of using builder pattern to preserve attribute immutability):
Modify Pizza and PizzaChainBuilder to mimic the UserBuilder type of design pattern which makes the attributes immutable. Pizza's attributes are now get-only in the Pizza class: internal state cannot be changed after a Pizza is constructed - i.e. immutability is ensured
